# The Legend Of Zelda In Multiplayer
Welcome into this repository, here you can download the latest released version of the build of The Legend Of Zelda In Multiplayer.

## What is this game?
This game is a fangame of the first zelda game in Unity, it's a web game so you can play to it in your browser.
And yea, it's a WIP recreation of the entire game but likes the title let you guess, the game is playable in multiplayer this time.

## What does the game look like?

## Are there any other changes to the original game?
Yea and not really, in fact, I removed the loading times between two areas (because it was useless and it was a bit complicated to recreate), 
those are limitations so it's pretty cool isn't it? Ah and I added PVP too.
